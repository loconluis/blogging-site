This year I didn't set the goal of one book per month. So between quick lectures, and big books, I enjoyed and learned a lot.

For me this year was important in terms of things that I discovered that I like. So I spent my time reading about poetry, culture, and some tech literature.
This was the best approach to have many point of view, and expand the way I see the world.

I always found the books as the best way to expand creativity and at the same time became aware about a topic and create a your own criteria.

So to finish this post. I'm going to write this:  *the hardest part to read is knowing what to read*. So let me know if you read one of these books or recommend others. 

Thanks for reading this post. You can reach me on my twitter [@LoconLuis](https://twitter.com/loconluis).
