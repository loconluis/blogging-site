In december 31th of 2016. I tried to set goals as usual, I say tried, because the normal is that those goals are not achieved. But this year it was a little bit diffent, I remember I was in my car and heard a guy talking on the radio
*Why you failed to achieved your goals*. He was talking about how people used to set unreachable goals, like for example: I want to run a 1000KM instead I want to run 10KM every day of the month. 
What him is trying to explain is: It is better to set small but achievable goals than to set big and unachievable goals.

So I followed suit. The main goal I set for myself that day was to read one book per month.
I think I made it, so this is the list that I want to share with all of you.
