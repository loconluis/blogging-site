        I spent most of the time as Full Stack Javascript Developer. So yeah I
        really love it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am self-taught, that is why I like to teach others the things,
        concepts and experiences that I learned in these years more as a mentor
        than as a teacher. Because you can always learn from someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate about technology, open source code and communities.
        Also I consider myself as enthusiast about Design. I like to explore the
        creative side of everything.

      <p>
        I spend my spare time with family, friends, playing videogames and
        catching up on all things about Sports.
