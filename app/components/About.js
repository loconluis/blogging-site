      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Luis Locon</strong>, currently I'm working as a Software
        Developer at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.cognits.co/" target="_blank">
          Cognits
        </a>
        , where I focus to Design and Develop solutions for our clients..
      </p>
      <p>
        I always consider myself as a <strong>curious</strong> person, and that
        has led me to be who I am a <strong>Self-Taught</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in the <strong>process</strong> that led to a complex
        solution, the why and the how. I like to contrast that learning process
        with the process of launching a new <strong>product</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about <strong>technology</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>innovation</strong>, <strong>OSS</strong>, and{" "}
        <strong>communities</strong>. I'm also a <strong>design</strong>{" "}
        enthusiast, I like to explore the creative side of everything and I
        think design is that. You can see how the artist solves a situation with
        creativity, in simple words I like <strong>creativity</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a community person, I like to <strong>teach</strong> what I learned,
        I really enjoy a lot spending time <strong>discussing/speaking</strong>{" "}
        to people about common topics, trends, and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Im not coding I enjoy spending my spare time with{" "}
        <strong>family and friends</strong>, <strong>traveling</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>videogames</strong>, <strong>reading books</strong>, and
        <strong>watching sports</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies are: Sneaker seeker and pet my{" "}
